# Digital Library SQL Project

This repository contains an SQL database project for managing a digital library. The main goal is to practice and demonstrate my SQL skills, including table creation, relationships, constraints, and queries, as part of my learning process and to strengthen my professional profile for job opportunities abroad.

- **Trial.sql**: Main script with database, table creation, and constraints.
- **Query Examples**: Includes examples of `SELECT` queries, conditions, aggregations, and table relationships.

## Main Tables

- **Author**: Information about authors.
- **Book**: Information about books and their relationship with authors.
- **Users**: Registered library users.
- **Loan**: Book loans to users.

## Features

- Integrity constraints (`CHECK`, `NOT NULL`).
- Examples of advanced conditions and queries.
- Structure designed to be easily extendable.

## Purpose

This project is aimed at self-learning and serves as a showcase of my SQL skills for job applications, especially abroad.  
Any suggestions or feedback are welcome.
