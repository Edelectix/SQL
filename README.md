# Digital Library SQL Project

This repository contains an updated SQL database project for managing a digital library. In this version, I corrected previous errors in the database script and added sample data directly within the same SQL file using INSERT statements. The objective remains to practice and demonstrate my knowledge of SQL, while improving the project with a functional dataset for testing.

## Project Structure

- **Digital_Library.sql**: Main script with the creation of the database, tables, constraints, corrections, and INSERT statements with example data.
- **Query Examples **: Includes examples of INSERT queries, conditions, aggregations, and relationships between tables.

## Main Tables

- **Author**: Information about authors.
- **Book**: Information about books and their relationship with authors.
- **Users**: Registered users of the library.
- **Loan**: Book loans to users.

## Features
- Corrected errors from the initial version of the database script.
- Use of primary and foreign keys.
- Integrity constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL).
- Sample data inserted into the tables for query testing.
- Structure designed to be easily expandable.

## Objective

This updated version of the project is aimed at self-learning, showcasing my ability to design, debug, and populate a database. It serves as a demonstration of my SQL skills for recruitment processes, especially abroad.
Any suggestions or feedback are welcome.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the 'Digital_Library.sql' script in your SQL Server database manager (it will create the structure and insert the sample data).
3. Modify or extend the queries according to your needs.
